### The Motivation for Development

🙋 Hey guys, I have some really cool news to share with you! My teammate and I created a random movie generator using NextJS 13 by Vercel.

**You know when you spend all night searching for a movie to watch and end up choosing something not so great? Well, we thought about that and created a solution to solve that problem!**

This project is part of a challenge we're doing, creating a project each week to enhance our knowledge of NextJS. And I can tell you that we're becoming more specialized in this amazing technology every day!
